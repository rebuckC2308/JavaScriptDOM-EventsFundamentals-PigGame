# JavaScriptDOM-EventsFundamentals-PigGame
This is the third and final project for this section.  This project is a dice game where two players will be playing one another with the goal to accumulate a score of at least 75 points!
This project was focused on reinforcing the skills that were learned in this section of the course. 

A player roles a dice.  The player then has the option to hold their current score or keep rolling. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible but roller beware, if you roll a 1 you will lose your accumulating score and it will be the next players roll!
